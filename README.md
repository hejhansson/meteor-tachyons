# PRINCIPLES

Everything should be 100% responsive
Your website should work regardless of a users device or screensize. Don't break the functionality of HTML with CSS.

Everything should be readable on any device
Just because it's readable to you on your laptop, doesn't mean it is readable by your users on their device. Make sure your type is big. Make sure your contrast is high.

Everything should be as performant as possible
Code isn't for making a developers life easier. It's for improving the lives of our users. If it's not doing that, why write it. A developer's time is not precious. A user's time is.

Designing in the browser should be easy
If a computer can do it, you shouldn't have to.

Doing one thing extremely well promotes reusability
Single purpose classes that are easy to grock.
